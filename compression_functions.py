   # The format for the frames that are compared to previous frames works as follows:
   # A number that indicates how far into the frame the changed pixel is.
   # The new color of the pixel.
   # Marker for end of frame.

   # Example: 0:00>
   # Change pixel `0` to color `00`, end of frame.

   # If no changes are present, the entire frame will be expressed as `>`.
   # Runs are not accounted for, every pixel gets its own entry.
   # There is no need to store the beginning and end of pixels, since the size of the color
   # is always 2 digits.

   # Example: 234:10123:05>
   # We take the entire string and split on :
   # 234 10123 05>
   # the first number in the frame is always an offset, so now we know to move
   # `234` pixels forwards, so we move, then discard.
   # 10123 05>
   # now we need the color of the pixel we just shifted over to, so we "pop" the first
   # 2 numbers in the next string
   # "10" 123 05>
   # we set the color of the pixel, then repeat.
   # 123 05>
   # 05>
   # >
   # When we hit the end of the frame, we will have 0 items left in the list, since
   # the string provided to the function has already had the `>` removed.

   # 234:121:01>12:0132:15>
   # 234:121:01 12:0132:15 "" # not sure if the final item will be empty, need to check.
